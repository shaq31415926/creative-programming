# Generating Art with Neural Networks

This directory contains code to generate art with the library [neuralart](https://pypi.org/project/neuralart/).

## Requirements
- Python3 +

## Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment 

- If you installed python with conda please follow the following steps to create a virtual environment called calc.
```bash
  conda create â€“-name art python
```

Activate your environment
```bash
  conda activate art
```

- If you do not have conda, create a virtual environment using the following steps

i. You need to install the library virtualenv
```bash
  pip3 install virtualenv
```

ii: Create a virtual environment called calc with virtualenv

Window users:
```bash
  python -m venv art
```

MAC users:
```bash
  virtualenv -p python art
```

iii. Activate your virtual environment

Window users:
```bash
  .\art\Scripts\activate
```

MAC users:
```bash
  source art/bin/activate
```

3. In your activated virtual environment, install the library neuralart
```bash
  pip3 install neuralart
```

4. Execute this code in your terminal to create an image generated by a randomly initialised neural network.
```bash
  neuralart \
      --seed 2 \
      --xres 2048 \
      --hidden-std 1.2 \
      example.png
```

5. If you would to create multiple images generated by the neural network, you can create a python script similar to this [example.py](??) and play around with the different parameters.  

```
python3 example.py
```

6. To convert the images to a video, carry out the following steps:

Install the library opencv 

```bash
  pip3 install opencv-python
```

You can create a python script similar to this [image_to_video.py](??) and play around with the different parameters.

```
python3 image_to_video.py
```
